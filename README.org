* fuselage

  A Leiningen template for Clojure/ClojureScript applications.

  The resulting application will use following:

  - [[https://github.com/funcool/catacumba][catacumba]] for http
    The main reason for using catacumba is that it has built-in support for doing async stuff using core.async.
  - [[https://github.com/Day8/re-frame][re-frame]] for UI
    Very nice React-based UI framework. Read the readme, it's well written.
  - [[https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel][figwheel]] for interactive UI development
    Just use it. Read the readme, watch the screencast.

  Don't forget to update dependencies after you generate the new app. One way to do it is to use [[https://github.com/xsc/lein-ancient][lein-ancient]] leiningen plugin.

* Stuff to do

** TODO Use something better than CSS
   Probably [[https://github.com/noprompt/garden][garden]]. Never used it but anything is better than raw CSS.
